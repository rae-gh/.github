# To do

- **Util** Make a util that takes a pdb file and returns the same but all the atom positions adjusted to the maxima  
  - **Analysis** Use this to run the analysis for C:O against CA:C:N+1 (tau+1) and show no correlation in pdb but correlation on adjusted maxima
   
- **Util** make a util that returns  
  - a) the coords of structures with similar features (pdb search)  
  - b) the adjusted maxima of those  
  - c) Superposes either adjusted or none adjusted slices  
  - **Analysis** use this to look at hydrogen bonds mentioned in lit review
 
- **Analysis** iron in different formations
