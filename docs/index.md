# Exploration of Electron Density and Cryo-EM Potential  
**in ultra-high resolution protein structures**  
**and a geometric analysis for criteria searching of density areas of interest**  
---  

The primary purpose of my PhD is to look for new information about interatomic bonds from ultra-high resolution x-ray crystallographic maps. The explosion in the solutions of ultra-high resolution structures has led to information about protein crystal structures being sampled up to every 0.3Å in ultra-high structures.  With the distances in the peptide bond between atoms being around 1.45Å (Engh&Huber, 2006) this is an opportunity to analyse data sampled within atomic bonds for new informaiton.  

### The density in a peptide bond
An example of an image of some electron density, where the red is a stronger density and you can see something interesting between the atoms (possibly not real).  This is a peptide bond with the C in the middle, the peptide bond to N+1 bottom left, the O on the right.
