# Electron Density Maps

The primary purpose of my PhD is to look for new information about interatomic bonds from ultra-high resolution x-ray crystallographic maps. The explosion in the solutions of ultra-high resolution structures has led to information about protein crystal structures being sampled up to every 0.3Ã… in ultra-high structures.
