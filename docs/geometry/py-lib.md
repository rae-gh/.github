# Python Library - prometry

The geometry code is simply accessible in a python library `prometry`.  

The library can be installed from PyPi with a simple pip install:
```bash
pip install prometry
```

The code and documentation is available:  
- GitHub: https://github.com/rae-gh/lib-prometry  
- API Documentation: https://rae-gh.github.io/lib-prometry/  
- PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/prometry/

I have created a web application to interact with it in a non-coding way, 
enabling you to create and explore correlations interactively, 
see next page [prometry-app](prometry.md)
